            <h2>PROJECT INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <h3>Below is the recsult of the collaboration between my team (<a href="https://github.com/elisecarman">Elise Carman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gaiello1">Gianna Aiello</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lordkariri">Karina Valrani</a>) and Zest- an online gifting platform helping brands scale by streamlining the gift-buying experience directly on their website. It offers multi-ship checkout, e-gifting, and corporate storefronts, with a concierge feature for brands to manage or process orders. Our redesign transforms a fragmented, self-guided setup process into a structured, intuitive flow that reduces reliance on customer support, shortens time to completion, and improves overall usability.

            <h2>CONSIDERATIONS/GOALS</h2>
            <h3>
                Zest entrusted us with redesigning their onboarding process for new vendors. 
                A few considerations we took into account when brainstorming collectively the new UI:
            </h3>
            <div class="notes-container">
                <div class="post-it">PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/><br/>
                    Users must complete a series of setup tasks before they can fully operate within Zest. These tasks range from integrating with Shopify to defining shipping rules. Some tasks are required for functionality while others are optional.
                </div>
                <div class="post-it">USER IDENTITY<br/><br/>
                    Zest clients often operate as teams rather than individuals. We should expect a client's finance team to provide details for Stripe Integration, while the marketing team handles branding. This implies the onboarding most likely cannot be completed in one go, and jumping around sections should be enabled.
                </div>
                <div class="post-it">USER MOTIVATIONS<br/><br/>
                    Users can only start using the platform once they have properly onboarded. They don't have a lot of time or energy to spend on onboarding, and need to get to their actual task as quickly as possible.
                    </div>
                <div class="post-it">PAIN POINTS<br/><br/>
                    Historically new clients have requested customer success meetings to correctly finish onboarding. 
                    There is no in app guided process besides a task checklist, and customers have pointed out a lack of clear instructions.
                    The existing in app guidance must be improved.

                    <h3>When designing our solution, we noticed that it is crucial that tasks are skippable, given that clients may not have all the information at the time of onboarding. In order to ensure that clients can be aided in the process of onboarding while still being able to keep track of tasks that they have completed/ still need to complete, we made 4 key design choices. </h3>

Upon exploring the onboarding UIs of well-established sites - Uber, Workday, Linkedin... - we decided to keep it all conventional, recognizing that the simplest, traditional methods of presenting information are omnipresent for a reason. Upon revision, we settled on offering users easily understandable question mark icons, which, upon hovering, would expand sought-after hints.')">

We have been told to reconsider whether the aforementioned method of toggling between them is intuitive and quick enough - especially for a user trying to toggle between non-consecutive tasks. While the carousel view introduced playfulness to the HCI and matched the companys visual branding, it was rather impractical. Upon reflecting on what should be prioritized when developing interfaces - in UI/UX dev, function over form! - we have decided to remove the carousel completely and display the tasks independently.')">

How would that be done in the first place? Upon reflecting on whether users would work with them at all - as well as discussing among ourselves whether such a functionality reflects our desire to reinvent the wheel, or is an actually useful option - we removed the reminders altogether and decided to completely replace them with pop-up messages alerting the user that they have unfinished sub-tasks. In the sidebar and profile view, users can now distinguish between completed and uncompleted tasks through checkmarks (lack thereof implying and unfinished task) and styling changes (regular text opacity, as opposed to lowered opacity of finished tasks) that appear.')">

            <h2>FINAL PROTOTYPE</h2>
            <h3>In our most recent meeting with our mentor, we discussed the importance of designing for the “general user” - someone who may be either highly experienced with similar systems or completely new to onboarding functionalities. While we've removed the "wizard" option in prior interations - as it would greatly slow down the former group - we kept the "show hint" option, which Christine appreciated. We've also discussed the necessity of keeping the end-user engaged through the process, and it's certainly an aspect we'd improve on in the future. Our current impersonal task view could be potentially preceded with a welcome page greeting the user on first run. The transitions between tasks could also be enhanced, possibly with a carousel animation, as pictured in our lo-fi prototypes. We've also been asked about the progress bar, which we ultimately decided to replace with "estimated completion time" as we were unsure whether the former would relate to all subtasks or just the required ones. In future versions, we'd compare the efficiency of the two, by analyzing their corresponding bounce rates.</h3>
